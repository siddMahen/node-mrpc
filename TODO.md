# node-mrpc

## Remove Functions From Remote and Local

Or else these things will just keep pilling up.

## Lack of Authentication and Encryption

Although `dnode` doesn't require this, I think this is important, particularly
since `mrpc` supports RPC over TCP.

I'm pretty sure I can take advantage of TLS and just convert my server to a
TLS.

## No Tests

Need to add test cases.
